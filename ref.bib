  abstract  = {A comprehensive performance evaluation system for  Photomultiplier tubes has been built up. The system is able to review  diverse cathode and anode properties for PMTs with different sizes and  dimensions. Relative and direct methods were developed for the quantum  efficiency measurement and the results are consistent with each other.  Two-dimensional and three-dimensional scanning platforms were built to test  both the cathode and anode uniformity for either the plane type or spherical  type photocathode. A Flash Analog-to-Digital Convertor module is utilized to  achieve high speed waveforms sampling. The entire system is highly automatic  and flexible. Details of the system and some typical experimental results  are presented in this paper.}
